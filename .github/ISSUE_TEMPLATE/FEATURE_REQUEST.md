If you haven't found or started a thread on the Swift UserDefault yet, consider
socializing your idea in the "Discussion"
(https://github.com/orgs/swift-library/discussions) after submitting this request.
While GitHub issues do great for tracking
purposes, the forums are far better ground for drawing attention to ideas and
gauging interest from the community.

they work.

addressing the problem, and why you chose this approach instead.
